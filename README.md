Developed a fully automated trading bot in Python that executes buy and sell orders for SPY stock based on the Supertrend technical indicator. The bot integrates with the Alpaca API for real-time data retrieval and order execution, calculates Supertrend signals using custom indicator logic, and manages trade decisions for 100-share lots. Designed for paper trading, the project demonstrates skills in algorithmic trading, API integration, and Python automation.

Key technologies: Python, Alpaca API, REST, financial data analysis, algorithmic trading
